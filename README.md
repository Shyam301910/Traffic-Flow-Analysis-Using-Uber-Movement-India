# Introduction
Studies on city layout and traffic patterns have long been of interest to urban planning. Given the growing accessibility of GPS and cell phone data over the past ten years, this interest has grown. Despite the fact that significant work has been done in this field, the GPS taxi trajectory data sets used in early research often only covered very short periods of time, hence a temporal component was infrequently incorporated in traffic flow. Since traffic needs have a dynamic behaviour, urban flow cannot be depicted using simply static metrics. Fortunately, the development of the digital age has led to a huge increase in the amount of knowledge regarding human mobility and location. In this paper, we present a dynamic analysis of the only newly developed and very potent Uber ride data collection, and we apply the findings to predict urban mobility. In order to determine the traffic on the routes that are available, we constructed a number of graphs depending on the connectivity between the various cities. The degree of each and every ward in the city can be used to do this. In order to examine the traffic flow using the retrieved dataset, we also calculated additional crucial metrics like betweenness, closeness, centrality, etc. We have excellent reason to believe that the availability of affordable ride-sharing services like Uber has significantly increased the variety and quantity of people who use cabs as their primary mode of transportation.
